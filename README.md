This repository contains Python programs that illustrate basic neural network machine learning methods, as seen in the BUSI 4720 course (Business Analytics) at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

These examples were developed with Tensorflow 2.14.1. Importantly, that version of TF still used Keras 2.x. Add the following line to if you're using TF 2.16.1 or higher with Keras 3:

`import os;os.environ["TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS"]="1"`
